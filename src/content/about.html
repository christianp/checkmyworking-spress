<p>This blog is a place for me to write some notes about the research I&#8217;m doing, for the clarification of my thoughts and the amusement of passers-by.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m Christian Perfect, a PhD maths student at Newcastle University.</p>
<p>This blog uses <a href="http://www.mathjax.org/" target="_blank">MathJax</a> for clever maths typesetting. It&#8217;s really rather marvellous.</p>
